              Your work history and reviews are stored on-chain at the network level. When you grow
              your reputation, it&apos;s visible to hirers across integrated platforms. Your
              reputation is owned by you, forever - backed by the blockchain.

              <br />
              TalentLayer IDs are soul-bound NFTs that represent your on-chain work history. Every
              ID has a unique handle and is searchable on platforms in the network. As you complete
              jobs, reviews that are left for you by hirers are associated with your handle.
              TalentLayer IDs don&apos;t live in a silo - they&apos;re designed to be composable
              with any other forms of identity.
